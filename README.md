Structured analysis of a security incident using the five NIST CSF functions:  
**Identify – Protect – Detect – Respond – Recover**

### 🔍 Key Activities
- Identified abnormal login activity and compromised endpoints  
- Mapped incident elements to NIST CSF functions  
- Created a full incident response plan  
- Detected missing controls (MFA, patching, logging gaps)  
- Outlined containment and recovery actions  

### 🎯 Outcome
- Clear IR workflow  
- Improved defensive measures  
- Documented lessons learned  
- Stronger access control and hardening strategy
